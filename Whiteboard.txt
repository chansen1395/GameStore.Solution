As a user, I want to create an account.
As a user, I want to be able to log in and log off.
As a user, I want to be able to see my account details.
Add authorization:

As a user, I should only be able to create, read, update and delete if I am logged in.


OR

As a user, I should only be able to create, update and delete if I am logged in. All users should be able to have read functionality.
Library
Create an app to catalog a library's books and let patrons check them out. Below are some user stories to get you started. To differentiate between the two users (librarians and patrons) and their unique needs, create separate locations in the app for each user to go to access their functionality. There's no one way to do this, so discuss with your pair what the best structure is before you start coding. Make sure to add basic authentication.

As time allows, explore the optional further exploration topic of authorization with user roles to distinguish between librarians and patrons. Authorization with user roles is introduced in an upcoming lesson, and is not required for the independent project.

// As a librarian, I want to create, read, update, delete, and list books in the catalog, so that we can keep track of our inventory.
// As a librarian, I should only be able to create, update and delete if I am logged in. All users should be able to have read functionality. (Hint: authorize CUD routes for books.)
As a librarian, I want to search for a book by author or title, so that I can find a book when there are a lot of books in the library.
// As a librarian, I want to enter multiple authors for a book, so that I can include accurate information in my catalog. (Hint: make an authors table and a books table with a many-to-many relationship.)
As a patron, I want to check a book out, so that I can take it home with me. I should only be able to do this if I am logged in.
// As a patron, I want to know how many copies of a book are on the shelf, so that I can see if any are available. (Hint: make a copies table; a book should have many copies.)
As a patron, I want to see a history of all the books I checked out, so that I can look up the name of that awesome sci-fi novel I read three years ago. (Hint: make a checkouts table that is a join table between patrons and copies.)
As a patron, I want to know when a book I checked out is due, so that I know when to return it.
As a librarian, I want to see a list of overdue books, so that I can call up the patron who checked them out and tell them to bring them back - OR ELSE!
